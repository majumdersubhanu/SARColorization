# SAR Image Processing Pipeline

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive pipeline for processing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images to produce
high-resolution optical images. The pipeline is divided into three main stages: despeckling, colorization, and
super-resolution. Each stage leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, ensuring that the final output is a
high-quality optical image free of noise, accurately colorized, and enhanced in resolution.

### Components of the Pipeline

1. **Despeckling**: The process of removing speckle noise from SAR images, which is critical for enhancing image quality
   and subsequent processing steps.

2. **Colorization**: Translating SAR images into pseudo-optical images by adding realistic color to the despeckled SAR
   image.

3. **Super-Resolution**: Upsampling the colorized image to produce a high-resolution optical image that is suitable for
   detailed analysis.

## 1. Despeckling

### Objective

SAR images often suffer from speckle noise, which degrades the image quality and makes interpretation difficult. The
goal of the despeckling stage is to remove this noise while preserving the essential features of the image.

### Approach

We employ a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture inspired by ResNet, which includes multiple skip
connections. These connections allow the network to preserve important features across layers and mitigate the issue of
vanishing gradients during training. The network is trained using a hybrid loss function that combines pixel-wise
accuracy and feature preservation.

### Mathematical Foundation

The noise model for SAR images is typically expressed as:

$$y = n \times x$$

Where:

- $( y )$ is the noisy SAR image.
- $( x )$ is the clean image.
- $( n )$ is the multiplicative speckle noise following a Gamma distribution.

The despeckling process aims to estimate the clean image $( x )$ from the noisy observation $( y )$.

## 2. Colorization

### Objective

After despeckling, the SAR image is grayscale and lacks the information needed to interpret it visually as an optical
image. The colorization stage translates the SAR image into a pseudo-optical image, introducing realistic color to the
despeckled image.

### Approach

The colorization process is achieved using a deep learning network with an encoder-decoder architecture, incorporating
skip connections to retain low-level information between the input and output. The network is trained with a loss
function that combines the pixel-wise $( L1 )$ loss, which encourages accurate reconstruction, and an adversarial loss,
which ensures that the colorization appears natural and realistic.

### Mathematical Foundation

The loss function used in the colorization network is a combination of the $( L1 )$ loss and adversarial loss:

$$\mathcal{L} = \lambda_1 \mathcal{L}_{L1} + \lambda_2 \mathcal{L}_{adv}$$

Where:

- $( \mathcal{L}_{L1} )$ is the pixel-wise $( L1 )$ loss, promoting accuracy.
- $( \mathcal{L}_{adv} )$ is the adversarial loss, encouraging the network to produce visually realistic outputs.
- $( \lambda_1 )$ and $( \lambda_2 )$ are weights that balance the contributions of the two losses.

## 3. Super-Resolution

### Objective

The colorized image is still at the original resolution of the SAR image, which might not be sufficient for detailed
analysis. The super-resolution stage enhances the resolution of the colorized image, producing a high-resolution optical
image.

### Approach

Super-resolution is achieved by applying a deep CNN that learns to upsample the low-resolution image while preserving
the quality and details. This network is trained to minimize a loss function that encourages both high fidelity to the
original image and the production of sharp, high-resolution details.

### Mathematical Foundation

The super-resolution process can be mathematically represented as:

$$
\hat{y} = G(z)
$$

Where:

- $( z )$ is the low-resolution colorized image.
- $( G )$ is the super-resolution generating function.
- $( \hat{y} )$ is the high-resolution output image.

## Results

The combined pipeline has been tested on various datasets and demonstrates significant improvements in image quality,
particularly in terms of noise reduction, color accuracy, and resolution enhancement. Key performance metrics such as
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) indicate the effectiveness of the pipeline
compared to existing methods.

## Conclusion

This pipeline represents a robust approach to processing SAR images, transforming noisy, grayscale SAR data into
high-resolution, colorized optical images suitable for detailed analysis and interpretation. The integration of
despeckling, colorization, and super-resolution techniques provides a comprehensive solution for improving the usability
and interpretability of SAR images in various applications.

## Future Work
